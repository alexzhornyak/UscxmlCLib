## State Machines in C++ Builder, Delphi and others
[uSCXML](https://github.com/tklab-tud/uscxml) is a great library and I always wanted to use it in C++ Builder, but unfortunately Borland C++ Compiler is quite a specific thing. After many unsuccessful attempts to compile it with Borland C++ Compiler I decided to create wrapper which would be easy to install. Solution was to create C library which would be definetely built on all versions of Borland C++ Compiler. Also I decided to simplify some things which seemed to be redundant for using in C++ Builder.
